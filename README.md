# JavaPractice intro
These are the codes created while solving problems.    
I started using GitHub to store my codes systematically and safely.   
Coding tests are from school.programmers.co.kr   

> This repositary contains level 0 problems.

JavaPractice is for personal use.   
I am not fluent in English. Annotations and explanations can be wrong.

## Design   
* I tried to share my codes with who solve the same problems.   
But did not expect that level 0 problems are more than 100.   
So this is quite hard to see previous problems.   
There is ProblemsLv0 pakage and class name is translated title of problems.

* TDD(Test Driven Development) is tried.   
Where main() founded is testSet.
There are codes for using Integration Test.

* Some problems are solved in a way that just for fun.   
I just poped and wanted to try different methods.   

* I do not like to make dependency.   
I could use already existing pakages like java.util. but some method ( like selection sort ) are created myself.
## Discussion
* Next time I could try Junit for unit test.
* Maven can be also used for dependency management.
